# C# Starter Kit

Welcome to the C# Starter Kit! Dive into C# and the .NET ecosystem with a well-organized repository tailored to guide beginners from the basics to advanced concepts, sample projects, and beyond.

## A Brief History of C# and .NET

C# (pronounced "C Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in the early 2000s. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team, aiming to combine the power of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic.

The .NET Framework, also launched by Microsoft, provides a runtime environment in which C# applications are executed. Over the years, .NET has evolved, leading to the introduction of .NET Core, a cross-platform, open-source framework, and eventually to the unified .NET 5 (and beyond), merging the capabilities of the original .NET Framework with .NET Core.
